Kotor boasts an exceptional composition of emerald green mountains, azure-tinted sea extending into the bay, and the Old Town of Stari Grad. Both the city and the adjacent Kotor Bay (Boka Kotorska) are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Kotor ranks not only as one of Montenegro's finest destinations but also among the most captivating spots in the entire Adriatic region. The town's remarkable natural beauty, with untouched pine forests framing pristine pebble beaches, is especially appealing. During the summer, the beaches, popular among European and Russian tourists, come alive with activity. Known as the 'Miami of Montenegro,' Budva also enjoys popularity due to its visa-free travel option for Turkish citizens.",
